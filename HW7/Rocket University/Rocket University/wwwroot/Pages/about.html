        <h2 class="whiteh"><center>Our Vision</center></h2>
        <div class="whitep">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The faculty, staff, and students of Rocket University share a common goal.
            This goal is to usher in a new age of space travel characterized by thorough research and cutting edge engineering practices.
            We believe this goal can be reached with a mentality of universal cooperation.
            Although our facilities are located in the United States, we truly are an international and interplanetary organization.
            We employ and accept the greatest minds from across the globe, as well as those who boast origins in more exotic places, such as the lunar and Martian colonies.
            By championing the ideals of inclusion and diversity, our reach will continue to expand across the galaxy and beyond!
